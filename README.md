# SnoozyNo
Drowsiness Detection

I created this as my Graduation Project. 

This project is a prototype backbone for a Driver Drowsiness Detection system which uses Computer Vision using OpenCV to capture frames of your eyes using your camera, the frames are then matched to a self trained model to determine if they are open or closed. The duration of the eyes remaining closed then determines if the person(driver) is drowsy or not, the system then rings an alarm to wake the driver up. The project used concepts of Machine Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and was created in Python programming Language. The interface was build using Streamlit as it is just a prototype that can be used to develop more advanced solutions.
